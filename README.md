## Features

- **Hot Seat Expiry** — each player can only have 3 moves on the board at any time. The oldest move disappears when a 4th is placed, keeping the board dynamic and prevent deadlocks.
- **Expiry Warning** — the cell about to expire is highlighted in yellow so players can plan around it
- **Win Detection** — horizontal, vertical and diagonal wins are all recognised, with the winning three cells highlighted in green
- **Restart** — reset the board at any point without relaunching the app

## Getting the App
Download the app in the dist folder. Note that this may not be the latest
version. To get use the latest version, please refer to the below.

## Running Locally

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, tkinter (included in standard Python installs)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JimbyJuice/tictactoe.git
cd tictactoe
python main.py
```

## Building a Standalone Executable

Uses [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) to bundle into a single file.

For MacOS:
```bash
pip3 install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.icns main.py
```

For Windows (Untested):
```bash
pip3 install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico main.py
```

The executable is output to the `dist/` folder. Share that file directly.

> **Note:** executables are platform-specific. Build on Mac to get a Mac app, build on Windows to get a `.exe`.
